# What is this?
An elegant (cursed) rewrite of Rhino Linux's [rhino-system](https://github.com/rhino-linux/rhino-system) utility.

# Why?
The original application is not responsive to different screen sizes, the window doesn't even scale, my rewrite addresses these responsiveness issues.

# Works?
Yes, it's a complete, fully-functional rewrite.
